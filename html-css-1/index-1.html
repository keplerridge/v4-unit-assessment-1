                    <img src='htmllogo.png' alt='HTML Logo'>
                     <p>HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and 
                        presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth 
                        and latest major version of HTML that is a World Wide Web 
                        Consortium(W3C) recommendation. The current specification 
                        is known as the HTML Living Standard and is maintained 
                        by a consortium of the major browser venors(Apple, Google, 
                        Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application 
                        Technology Working Group(WHATWG).
                        <br><br>
                        HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 
                        January 2008, with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" 
                        status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the 
                        language with support for the latest multimedia and 
                        other new features; to keep the language both easily 
                        readable by humans and consistently understood by 
                        computers and devices seuch as web browsers, parsers, 
                        etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain 
                        backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is 
                        intended to subsume not only HTML4 but also XHTML1 
                        and DOM Level 2 HTML.</p>

            <h1>About CSS3</h1>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet 
                language used for describing the presentation 
                of a web document written in a markup language 
                like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the 
                World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                <br><br>
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation 
                and conten, including layout, colors, and fonts. This 
                separation can improve content accessibility, provide more 
                flexibility and control in the specification of 
                presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages 
                to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a 
                separat .css file, and reduce complexity and repition in 
                the structural content. Separation of formatting and 
                content also makes it feasible to present the same markup 
                page inn different styles for different rendering methods, 
                such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based 
                browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile 
                devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if 
                the content is accessed on a mobile device. The name cascading 
                comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style 
                rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. 
                This cascadign priority scheme is predicatable.
                <br><br>
                The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web 
                Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is 
                registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C 
                operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents. In 
                addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS 
                including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
